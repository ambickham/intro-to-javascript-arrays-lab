Exercise 4: Access an array element

1) Retrieve the 'pizza' string from the array based on its position (index) in
   the array.  

2) Assign it to a variable called `favFood`.

// Complete Exercise 4 in the space below:
// */

// const foods = [ "taco", "pizza", "cheeseburger"] // Defining a variable

Exercise 5: Insert an element between two others

1) Insert the string 'tofu' between 'pizza' and 'cheeseburger' in the array.

Complete Exercise 5 in the space below:
*/


// const foods = [ "taco", "pizza","cheeseburger"];
// foods.splice(2,0,"tofu");

Exercise 6: Replace elements

1) Replace 'pizza' in the `foods` array with 'sushi' and 'cupcake'.

Complete Exercise 6 in the space below:
// */
// const foods = [ "taco", "pizza","cheeseburger"];
// foods.splice (1,1, "sushi", "cupcake");

// I did not need to include "pizza" in the () since the other items were going to replace it. By keeping pizza, I actually ended up insertig it back in. 
/*
Exercise 7: Using the `slice()` method

1) Use the `slice()` method to create a new array that contains 'sushi' and 
   'cupcake'.

2) Assign it to a variable named `yummy`.

Complete Exercise 7 in the space below:
*/

// const foods = [ "taco", "pizza", "sushi", "cupcake", "cheeseburger"];
// const yummy = foods.slice (2,4);
// console.log('Exercise 7 result:', yummy);

// Continue to check spelling 
// Always check semicolon at the end to finish the command. 
// Remember that the index starts at 1, and by referencing the index as in this example, that's the object that I'm extracting. 

/*
Exercise 8: Finding an index

1) Using the `indexOf()` method, find the index of the string 'tofu' in the 
   `foods` array. 

2) Assign it to a variable named `soyIdx`.

Complete Exercise 8 in the space below:
*/

const foods = [ "taco", "pizza", "sushi", "cupcake", "cheeseburger", "tofu"];
const soyIdx = (foods.indexOf("tofu"));
console.log(foods.indexOf('tofu'))
// Print => 5, successfully printed. 
// Remember you don't have to console.log again since the statement above is the console.log
// Read the prompt carefully, this is asking to reassign the variable. 
// To assign a new variable, set to const reference the first one. Example above.
